[![YueSha's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=yuesha-yc)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)


The following page contains information about Myself. 
If you are interested in what kind of person I am, keep reading. 

## Name
YueSha, this is my full name on internet.
It doesn't really have a special meaning or something, it was just named by the first thought when I bought a Minecraft account. 
Yichen (IPA: ìːʈʂʰə́n CN: 一陈), this is my first name in real life. It is also acceptable to call me that. 

## Age
17 (born 2003)

## Gender
I don't really care because I don't believe it matters on most things I do. 
Also, I dislike bias that says different genders have different apatitudes in specific tasks.

## Location
Beijing, China

## Languages
English, Chinese, and a bit of Spanish.

## Education
I am a 12th grade high school student at Beijing National Day School (BNDS). I spent 6 years at BNDS through 7th grade to 12th grade. 
I am in Advanced Placement (AP) department of my school so I am an international applicant for universities abroad. 
Currently I am in my application process! (Will update this after I get my offer XD). 

## Occupation
Obviously, Student
